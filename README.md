# App Description â€“ Animal Adoption Platform

## Purpose
Connect potential adopters with shelters by providing a seamless and engaging adoption experience.

## User Experience
Users will browse animal profiles through an interactive swipe-based interface.

Swipe right to like an animal, swipe left to pass.

The app will analyze user preferences based on their swiping behavior.

At the end of the selection process, users will see a personalized recommendation page displaying animals that best match their preferences.

## Recommendation System
Works like a Netflix-style index page, showcasing multiple recommended animals.

Suggestions are based on swipe history, animal traits, and potential machine-learning insights.

## Animal Details Page
Clicking on an animal opens a detailed profile, including:
- Animal Description
- Photos and additional shelter-provided information

## Target Users
- Adopters: Individuals looking to adopt pets based on their preferences.
- Shelters: Organizations managing animals and providing information for adoption.

This app simplifies the adoption process, making it engaging, data-driven, and user-friendly.
