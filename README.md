## Running The Project

1. Copy and paste the current `.env-example` file and rename it to `.env`.
2. Grant the necessary execution permissions to the `run-docker.sh` file w/ the command `chmod +x run-docker.sh`
3. Execute the `run-docker.sh` file.
4. Open the Postman file located in the `backend/postman.json` directory within the Postman app and test out some routes.

#### *As a good role of thumb, after every pull or before every push, run the .sh file again.*

#### *Only edit the root .env file otherwise changes will be lost*
